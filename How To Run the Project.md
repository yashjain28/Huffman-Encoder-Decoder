# Huffman-Encoder-Decoder
Run following command in the terminal to execute the command: 
$ make
$ java encoder <input_file_name>
Running encoder program will produce the output files with exact name "encoded.bin" and "code_table.txt"
$ java decoder <encoded_file_name> <code_table_file_name>

Following these inputs you can try executing for 100,000,000 records as well. It works usually in 2-3 minutes. For such a large input.
Basically, I have tried to write a highly scalable code.
Please feel free to contact me if there are any issues or suggestions.
The details of the code and the algortihms used to implement the same are there in the readme.pdf. Feel free to check it out.
